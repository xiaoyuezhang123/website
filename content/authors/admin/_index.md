I gained my first degree in Applied Psychology from the Beijing Sport University. Currently, I am a MRes Psychology student at the University of Manchester. My interests include decision-making and  gender stereotypes and qualitative methodologies.

I have experience with qualitative and quantitative methodologies. For my undergraduate dissertation I designed and conducted psychological experiments independently by E-prime to study the impact of different state anxiety levels on the risk decision-making of college students with different procrastination levels. During my MRes, I excelled in Qualitative Research Methods modules where my grades gradually improved.
